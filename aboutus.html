      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <div class="mission">
       <p>FTC 19697 SOUP SWENext is a local chapter founded in 2023 by two sisters, Erin and Lana Chan.
         Together, we are creating a space where everyone can feel welcome and supported. Our goal is to inspire
         the next generation of women in engineering and help our members pursue and excel in STEM careers</p>
       <h3><b>Our Mission Statement:</b></h3>
       <p class = "StatementIndent">We want to create an environment where girls and women can see themselves as engineers
         and confidently embrace their talents. We want to showcase their skills and help them contribute to the ever-evolving
         landscape of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our primary aim is to foster a
         community where diversity is celebrated, equality is preserved, and opportunities for growth are limitless.</p>
       <h3><b>Inspiring the Next Generation:</b></h3>
       <p class = "StatementIndent">We are committed to inspiring the next generation of women in engineering.
         We hope to ignite the spark of curiosity and possibility in young minds through a range of outreach
         events, workshops, and mentoring initiatives. By providing hands-on experiences, we aim to empower
         girls to believe in their potential and pursue their passions with confidence.</p>
       <h3><b>Promoting Diversity and Equality:</b></h3>
       <p class = "StatementIndent">Diversity is our strength. Our SWENext chapter is committed to promoting diversity in all
         its forms. We recognize that varying perspectives and experiences drive innovation and progress. By providing a
         safe and inclusive space, we ensure that every woman’s voice is heard, valued, and respected. We actively
         seek opportunities to collaborate with organizations that share our dedication to breaking down barriers
         and promoting equality in the STEM fields.</p>
       <h3><b>Empowering Underserved Communities:</b></h3>
       <p class = "StatementIndent">We believe that access to education and opportunities should not be limited by
         socioeconomic factors. Our Local Chapter places special emphasis on outreach to underserved communities.
         Through targeted initiatives, workshops, and partnerships, we are dedicated to bridging the gap and providing
         equitable access to STEM resources for all, regardless of their background.</p>
       <h3><b>Join Us in Shaping the Future:</b></h3>
       <p class = "StatementIndent">As a member of our Society for Women Engineers Local Chapter, you become
         part of a community dedicated to making a difference. Whether you’re a student dreaming of engineering wonders,
         a professional navigating a STEM career, or someone who believes in the power of diversity and equality, there’s
         a place for you here. Together, we can inspire, uplift, and shape the future of engineering and beyond.</p>
       <br>
       <p>We invite you to be a part of our movement, to celebrate achievements, overcome challenges, and make
         strides toward a world where every woman’s journey in STEM is supported, and celebrated. Join us as we pave
         the way for a brighter, more inclusive tomorrow.</p>
